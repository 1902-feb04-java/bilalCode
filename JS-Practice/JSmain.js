//Javascript


//errors are silently ignored, but ES5 starts to change
//ECMAScript 5 (ES5), version of JS
//ES6 (or ES2015) is a new form of JS that is not yet standardized

//JS is not a compliled language, instead interpreted

// JS is object-based (object oriented), without classes, but from ES6 onwards, JS implements classes
// JS uses what's called "prototypal inheritance" to reuse behavior between objects

// JS is dynamically typed - variables do not have a type at all
